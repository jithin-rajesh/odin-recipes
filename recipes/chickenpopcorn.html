    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Popcorn chicken is a dish of bite-sized chunks of deep-fried chicken that are sure to be the perfect meal on a Friday Movie Night. I love to eat it with a Chicken Sandwich.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups flour</li>
        <li>2 tps garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tbps lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 cups oil</li>
        <li>3 boneless chicken breasts, cubed</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1</b><br>Mix flour, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Beat eggs and lemon juice together in a separate bowl.</li>
        <li><b>Step 2</b><br>Heat 2 inches of oil in a large pot over medium heat.</li>
        <li><b>Step 3</b><br>Dredge chicken pieces in flour mixture; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back into the bowl. Press into flour mixture again to coat.</li>
        <li><b>Step 4</b><br>Lower pieces of chicken carefully into hot oil in batches; fry until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces.</li>
    </ol>
